## Google Search Clone
This is a clone of Google Search featuring Google Images and Advanced Search, created as Project 0 of Harvard's CS50W course. The project is built using HTML and CSS.

## Demo
You can view a demo of the project **[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRqqAp8yqeQ).**

**Timestamp:**

00:00 Your website should have at least three pages: one for regular Google Search (which must be called index.html), one for Google Image Search, and one for Google Advanced Search. On the Google Search page, there should be links in the upper-right of the page to go to Image Search or Advanced Search. On each of the other two pages, there should be a link in the upper-right to go back to Google Search.

00:15 On the Google Search page, the user should be able to type in a query, click “Google Search”, and be taken to the Google search results for that page. Like Google’s own, your search bar should be centered with rounded corners. The search button should also be centered, and should be beneath the search bar.

00:28 On the Google Image Search page, the user should be able to type in a query, click a search button, and be taken to the Google Image search results for that page.

00:40 On the Google Advanced Search page, the user should be able to provide input for the following four fields (taken from Google’s own advanced search options) Find pages with… “all these words:” Find pages with… “this exact word or phrase:” Find pages with… “any of these words:” Find pages with… “none of these words:”

00:55 Like Google’s own Advanced Search page, the four options should be stacked vertically, and all of the text fields should be left aligned. Consistent with Google’s own CSS, the “Advanced Search” button should be blue with white text. When the “Advanced Search” button is clicked, the user should be taken to the search results page for their given query.

01:32 Add an “I’m Feeling Lucky” button to the main Google Search page. Consistent with Google’s own behavior, clicking this link should take users directly to the first Google search result for the query, bypassing the normal results page.

The CSS you write should resemble Google’s own aesthetics.


## Features

Three Pages: The website consists of three pages:
index.html: Regular Google Search page.
image.html: Google Image Search page.
advanced.html: Google Advanced Search page.


## Navigation:

Links in the upper-right corner of each page allow users to navigate between the different search pages.
Search Functionality:
On the Google Search page (index.html), users can type in a query and click "Google Search" to be taken to the search results page for that query.
On the Google Image Search page (image.html), users can type in a query and click a search button to be taken to the Google Image search results.
On the Google Advanced Search page (advanced.html), users can provide input for specific search criteria, such as "all these words", "this exact word or phrase", "any of these words", and "none of these words". Clicking the "Advanced Search" button takes users to the search results page for their given query.
I'm Feeling Lucky:
The main Google Search page (index.html) features an "I'm Feeling Lucky" button. Clicking this button takes users directly to the first Google search result for the query, bypassing the normal results page.


## CSS Styling
The CSS styling of the project resembles Google's own aesthetics, including centered search bars with rounded corners, blue "Advanced Search" buttons with white text, and consistent alignment of text fields on the Advanced Search page.
